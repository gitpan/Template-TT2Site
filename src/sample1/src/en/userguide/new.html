<p>To set up a new <tt>Template::TT2Site</tt> site, create a new
directory. In this directory, issue the following command:

<pre>  $ make -f $TT2SITE_LIB/common.mk setup
</pre>

<p>This will populate the directory with the necessary files and
directories to create the web site. Among these is a <tt>Makefile</tt>
which provides the following targets:

<ul>
  <li><b>build</b> (default)
      <br>Run the <tt>ttree</tt> application to update all site data.
  <li><b>rebuild</b>
      <br>Run <tt>ttree</tt> to completely rebuild all site data.
  <li><b>clean</b>
      <br>Cleanup the generated data (and some other things, like
      editor backup files).
  <li><b>realclean</b>
      <br>Cleanup the generated data and the files originally
      installed with the setup.
</ul>

Almost for certain, you'll have to create in the <tt>lib</tt>
directory, the templates <tt>config/site</tt> and
<tt>config/images</tt>.
<br>If you want to make a multi-lingual site you need to create an
appropriate <tt>config/lang</tt>. But in many cases this will be all
you need to get started creating your web pages.
