<p><b>Template::TT2Site</b> needs to be installed before it can be
used. You can do this by unpacking the kit it in an arbitrary
location, and issue the following commands:

<pre>  perl Build.PL
  Build
  Build install
</pre>

Alternatively, you can use the <tt>CPAN</tt> or <tt>CPANPLUS</tt>
tools to install <tt>tt2site</tt> for you.

<p>Note that the last command requires write access to your local Perl
installtion.
