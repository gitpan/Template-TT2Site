<p><b>Template::TT2Site</b> does not need to be installed, just unpack
it in an arbitrary location. There are only two requirements to use
it:

<ul>
  <li>Environment variable <tt>TT2SITE_LIB</tt> must point to the
      installation.
  <li>The installation location must be made available to the Perl
      search path.
</ul>

<p>The installation directory contains the usual <tt>Makefile.PL</tt>.
Although there is nothing needed to install, running

<pre>  perl Makefile.PL
</pre>

will check your installation for completeness.
