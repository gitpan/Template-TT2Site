Most web sites use a menu to navigate. <b>Template::TT2Site</b>
automatically creates the menu, using <b>.map</b> files placed in the
directories to navigate. The avantage of <b>.map</b> files is that they
can easily be maintained with the directory data, and directories can
be moved to another location taking the map data with them.

<p>The <b>.map</b> files contain lines as follows:

<pre>  menu "Title" target
</pre>

<p>The target will appear in the menu as "Title". The target can be an
HTML page (if the file <i>target</i><tt>.html</tt> exists), a
directory (if it exists, introducing a new level of navigation),
otherwise it will be taken to be an arbitrary URL.

<p>In addition, the top level <tt>.map</tt> must contain an entry

<pre>  title "Menu Title"
</pre>
