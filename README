Template::TT2Site is a framework to create web sites using the
Template Toolkit.

The technical structure of the site is patterned after the method
described in I<The Badger Book>. The structure has been slightly
simplified for ease of use, and a couple of neat features are added:

* The resultant site is position independent, i.e., it only uses
  relative URLs to the extent possible. This makes it easy to build
  partial sites, and to relocate the contents.

* The necessary means are provided to create multi-language sites, where
  each page gets a link to its translations.

* The 'site.map' hash, required for site navigation, is created
  automatically using minimal, position independent, directions.
