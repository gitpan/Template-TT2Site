<p>This is a sample site created with the <b>Template::TT2Site</b>.
builder.

<p><b>Template::TT2Site</b> is a framework to create web sites using
the Template Toolkit.

<p>The technical structure of the site is patterned after the method
described in chapter 11 of <I>The Badger Book</i>. The structure has
been slightly simplified for ease of use, and a couple of neat
features are added:

<ul>
  <li>The resultant site is position independent, i.e., it only uses
      relative URLs to the extent possible. This makes it easy to build
      partial sites, and to relocate the contents.
  <li>The necessary means are provided to create multi-lingual sites, where
      each page gets a link to its translations.
  <li>Site navigation is automatically provided using minimal,
      position independent, directions. 
</ul>
