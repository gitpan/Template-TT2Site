When setting up a web site as described in chapter 11 of the <i>Badger
Book</i>, you use a work area where three directories are particulary
important.

<p>Directory <code>src</code> is where you put the templates that will
produce the actual HTML pages for the site. In general, each template
in this directory will produce exactly one HTML document.

<br>When these templates are processed, they make use of library
templates and other tools that reside in the <code>lib</code>
directory.

<br>Finally, the resultant HTML documents will be put in directory
<code>html</code>.

<p><b>Template::TT2Site</b> supports this process in the following
ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It sets up the basic
      structure of the work area: the <code>src</code>
      and <code>lib</code>
      directories, and populates them with start data. The <code>html</code>
      directory will be created automatically later. </li>
  <li>It will configure the
      information so that library materials can come from <i>two</i>
      sources: from your <code>lib</code>
      directory, or from a library that <b>Template::TT2Site</b>
      provides for you. Since in normal cases you will use many library
      templates 'as is', you need only provide the templates that differ from
      the standard version. </li>
  <li>It will perform the
      necessary steps to process your templates into HTML files in the <code>html</code>
      using one simple command: <b>tt2site</b>. </li>
</ul>

<p>By default, <b>tt2site setup</b> creates the following
subdirectiories in <code>src</code>:</p>

<pre>    src/images
    src/css<br></pre>

<p><code>css</code> contains the style sheet for the site. As you
might guess, you can edit <code>css/site.css</code> to change a number
of aspects of the look of your website.

<p>You will also notice that an <code>etc</code> directory has been
created, with a single file in it:</p>

<pre>    etc/ttree.cfg
</pre>

This file is the configuration for the <code>ttree</code> processor
that is used internally by <code>tt2site</code>. You shouldn't need to
modify this.

<p>What you do need to modify are the files in the <code>lib</code>
directory: </p>
<pre>    lib/config/site
    lib/config/images<br></pre>

The standard library resides under the <code>lib</code> directory of
the <b>Template::TT2Site</b> installation. Its major subdirectories
are <code>config</code> (configuration data), <code>page</code> (page
formatting), and <code>util</code> (utility functions).

<p>For the time being, the contents of the files need to be taken as a
guide how to write your own. Here is a short description of some
files:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>config/main</code></dt>
  <dd>This file controls which
      other files from the site directory are taken into account.</dd>
  <dt><code>config/site</code></dt>
  <dd>The site data like title and
      subject. This file must be overridden with actual data.</dd>
  <dt><code>config/images</code></dt>
  <dd>The definition of images to
      be used with the util/image template function.</dd>
  <dt><code>config/lang</code></dt>
  <dd>The definition of the
      languages to be used by this site.</dd>
  <dt><code>page/wrapper</code></dt>
  <dd>This file controls what
      templates are applied when processing user files.</dd>
  <dt><code>page/html</code></dt>
  <dd>This template provides the
      general HTML structure of the generated pages.</dd>
  <dt><code>page/layout</code></dt>
  <dd>This template defines the
      structure of the generated pages. It uses the familiar table approach
      with cells containing the logo, header, menu, contents, footer, and so
      on.</dd>
</dl>
