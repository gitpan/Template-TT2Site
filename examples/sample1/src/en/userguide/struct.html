<b>Template::TT2Site</b> works with two main sub-directories: 'src'
and 'html'.  These contain the raw input and the final output versions
of your website.

<p>The 'src' directory is created when you run <code>setup<code>, and
the 'html' directory is created when you first use the <code>build</code>
subcommand.

<p>By default, <b>tt2site</b> creates the following subdirectiories in
'src':
<pre>    src/images
    src/css
</pre>

<p><code>css</code> contains the style sheet for the site. As you
might guess, you can edit <code>css/site.css</code> to change a number
of aspects of the look of your website one place.

You will also see that an 'etc' directory has been created, with
this file in it:

<pre>    etc/ttree.cfg
</pre>

You shouldn't need to modify this.

<p>What you do need to modify are the files in the 'lib' directory:
<pre>    lib/config/site
    lib/config/images
</pre>

<b>Template::TT2Site</b> site is configured to take templates from two
sources: from the local directory, and from the <b>TT2Site</b> library.
The templates in the library directory provide (almost) all the
necessary information to create the site (except for the contents, of
course), the library templates can be overruled locally to customize a
particular site.

<p>The <b>TT2Site</b> library templates reside in the <code>lib</code>
directory. Its major subdirectories are <code>config</code>
(configuration data), <code>page</code> (page formatting), and
<code>util</code> (utility functions).

<p>For the time being, the contents of the files need to be taken as a
guide how to write your own. Here is a short description of some
files:

<dl>
<dt><code>config/main</code>
<dd>This file controls which other files from the site directory are taken into account.
<dt><code>config/site</code>
<dd>The site data like title and subject. This file must be overridden with actual data.
<dt><code>config/images</code>
<dd>The definition of images to be used with the util/image template function.
<dt><code>config/lang</code>
<dd>The definition of the languages to be used by this site.
<dt><code>page/wrapper</code>
<dd>This file controls what templates are applied when processing user files.
<dt><code>page/html.html</code>
<dd>This template provides the general HTML structure of the generated pages.
<dt><code>page/layout.html</code>
<dd>This template defines the structure of the generated pages. It uses the familiar table approach with cells containing the logo, header, menu, contents, footer, and so on.
