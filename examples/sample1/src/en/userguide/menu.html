Most web sites use a menu to navigate. <b>Template::TT2Site</b>
automatically creates the menu, using <b>.map</b> files placed in the
directories to navigate. The advantage of <b>.map</b> files is that they
can easily be maintained with the directory data, and directories can
be moved to another location taking the map data with them.

<p>This is how it works.

<p>In your main directory (the one with the top level
<code>index.html</code> in it, create a file <code>.menu</code> with
contents:

<pre>  title "Site Menu"
</pre>

Now, for each entry you want in this menu, add a line:

<pre>  menu "Title" target
</pre>

<p>The target will appear in the menu as "Title".

<p>The target can be an HTML page (if the file
<i>target</i><tt>.html</tt> exists), a directory (if it exists,
introducing a new level of navigation), otherwise it will be taken to
be an arbitrary URL.

<p>If the target is a directory, the menu item will point to the
<code>index.html</code> file in this directory. Also, if this
directory contains a <code>.map</code> file, the navigation menu will
be hierarchically expanded with the items from this directory.

<p>Note that the appearance of the actual menus is controlled by the
layout definition of the web pages (file <code>lib/page/layout</code>)
and the menu (file <code>lib/page/menu</code>).

<p>The visual appearance can be controlled with the style sheet
<code>css/site.css</code>. The menu items will belong to the CSS class
'menu', and the currently active link will be given the class
'menuselect'.
