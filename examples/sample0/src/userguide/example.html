Two example sites are included in the distribution kit.
<p><code>sample0</code> is a simple site containing this
documentation.
<p><code>sample1</code> is the same site in multi-language form.
<p>To use either site, change to the appropriate directory, and issue the commands:

<pre>  $ tt2site setup
  $ tt2site build
  ... point your browser at html/index.html ...
  $ tt2site realclean
</pre>
