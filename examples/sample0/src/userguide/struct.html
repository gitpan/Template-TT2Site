A <b>Template::TT2Site</b> site is configured to take templates from two
sources: from the local directory, and from the <b>TT2Site</b> library.
The templates in the library directory provide (almost) all the
necessary information to create the site (except for the contents, of
course), the library templates can be overruled locally to customize a
particular site.

<p>The library templates reside in the <code>lib</code> directory. Its
major subdirectories are <code>config</code> (configuration data),
<code>page</code> (page formatting), and <code>util</code> (utility
functions).

<p>For the time being, the contents of the files need to be taken as a
guide how to write your own. Here is a short description of some
files:

<dl>
<dt><code>site/main</code>
<dd>This file controls which other files from the site directory are taken into account.
<dt><code>site/config</code>
<dd>The site data like title and subject. This file must be overridden with actual data.
<dt><code>site/images</code>
<dd>The definition of images to be used with the util/image template function.
<dt><code>site/lang</code>
<dd>The definition of the languages to be used by this site.
<dt><code>page/wrapper</code>
<dd>This fike controls what templates are applied when processing user files.
<dt><code>page/html</code>
<dd>This template provides the general HTML structure of the generated pages.
<dt><code>page/layout</code>
<dd>This template defines the structure of the generated pages. It uses the familiar table approach with cells containing the logo, header, menu, contents, footer, and so on.
