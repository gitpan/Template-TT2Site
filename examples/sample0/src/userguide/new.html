<p>To set up a new <tt>Template::TT2Site</tt> site, create a new
directory. In this directory, issue the following command:

<pre>  $ tt2site setup
</pre>

<p>This will populate the directory with the necessary files and
directories to create the web site. You can consult section <a
href="struct.html">Site Structure</a> for the details on the installed
files.

First, you'll have to modify the files <tt>config/site</tt> and
<tt>config/images</tt> that were installed in the <tt>lib</tt>
directory.

<br>If you want to make a multi-lingual site you need to create an
appropriate <tt>config/lang</tt>. But in many cases this will be all
you need to get started creating your web pages.


<p>You can use the following subcommands with <tt>tt2site</tt>:

<ul>
  <li><b>build</b> (default)
      <br>Run the <tt>ttree</tt> application to update all site data.
  <li><b>rebuild</b>
      <br>Run <tt>ttree</tt> to completely rebuild all site data.
  <li><b>clean</b>
      <br>Cleanup the generated data (and some other things, like
      editor backup files).
  <li><b>realclean</b>
      <br>Cleanup the generated data and the files originally
      installed with the setup.
</ul>
